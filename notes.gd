TODO:
	

Need to fix:
	Start over enemy 
		sounds activate sectors
		doom has ticks it plays for each state?
		enemy flitch animation / flitch delay
	Pickup / throw / drop and switch guns
	Player Rollng (Alternative dash method?)
	Player Spawn
	Player moves too slow
	Gravity too floaty

Ai:
	attacking:
		attack animation for melee or projectile or raycast
		reaction time 
	activate enemy when:
		hits collision space in front of enemy,
			when raycast to player doesn't hit walls,
			goes to in range chase state
		sound,
			when attacking or jumping can cause alert enemy.....
	
	?how do doom sectors work?
	doom enemies have ambush flag trigger when you shoot,
		also increases feild of vission 
		
	
Direction to player 
	position player - position enemy noralized
	
	

Ideas:
	double jump
	grappling hook
	3d pathfinding goes up walls
